# Overview
This project is developed using Python, following OOP and using the `turtle` module. This simple "tennis like" game features two paddles and a ball, the goal is to defeat your opponent, a player gets a point once the opponent misses a ball.

# Instructions
Use the "arrow up" and "arrow down" keys to control the movement of the right-handed paddle, and the "w" and "s" keys to control the movement of the left-handed paddle. Anticipate the ball's direction and prevent it from escaping your paddle. Stay vigilant and responsive to maintain control and outmaneuver your opponent.
